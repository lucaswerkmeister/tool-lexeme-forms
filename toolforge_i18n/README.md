# Toolforge I18n

A **work in progress** library for making Toolforge tools written in Python translatable.

## How to use it

Don’t.

I’m serious. Please don’t use it yet.
I’m currently trying it out in a second tool of mine;
once that works out, I’ll make this properly usable by others.
Until then, please wait :)
