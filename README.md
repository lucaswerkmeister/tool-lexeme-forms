# Wikidata Lexeme Forms

[This tool](https://lexeme-forms.toolforge.org/) lets users create Wikidata lexemes with pre-populated forms,
such as the declensions of a noun or the conjugations of a verb.

## Toolforge setup

On Wikimedia Toolforge, this tool runs under the `lexeme-forms` tool name.
Source code resides in `~/www/python/src/`,
a virtual environment is set up in `~/www/python/venv/`,
logs end up in `~/uwsgi.log`.
The `uwsgi.ini` configuration file in the source code repository
is symlinked into `~/www/python/uwsgi.ini`.

To update the tool, assuming there were no changes in the Python environment:
```
git fetch
git log -p @..@{u} # inspect changes
git rebase
kubectl rollout restart deployment lexeme-forms
```

If there were new changes in the Python environment (e.g. new dependencies),
add the following steps after the `git rebase`:
```
webservice shell
source ~/www/python/venv/bin/activate
pip-sync ~/www/python/src/requirements.txt
```

If you’re fully restarting the webservice,
also update the Kubernetes deployment created by the `webservice` command afterwards:
```
webservice stop
# do whatever you need to do (new Python version -> new venv?)
webservice start
kubectl patch deployment lexeme-forms -p "$(<~/www/python/src/patch-add-startup-probe.yml)"
```

## Local development setup

You can also run the tool locally, which is much more convenient for development
(for example, Flask will automatically reload the application any time you save a file).
Note that a local setup will not actually perform edits unless you create a `config.yaml` file.

```
git clone https://gitlab.wikimedia.org/toolforge-repos/lexeme-forms.git
cd tool-lexeme-forms
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -r dev-requirements.txt
flask --debug run --extra-files i18n/en.json
```

If you want, you can do this inside some virtualenv too.
